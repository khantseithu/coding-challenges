# Challenge 3

## Objective
- React & TypeScript: Build the component using React and TypeScript.
- Form Validation: Implement basic form validation:
  - Validate email format.
  - Password should require at least 8 characters.
  - Display relevant error messages for invalid input.
- Tailwind CSS: Style your component with Tailwind CSS. Ensure it is responsive and visually appealing on both desktop and mobile screens.
- Submit Functionality: Show a success message upon valid submission; otherwise, display an error message.
- Code Quality: Ensure your code is clean, well-commented, and organized.

## Note

- In a real-world scenario, I would use a form library like Formik or react-hook-form to handle form validation and submission. However, for the purpose of this challenge, I will implement the form validation and submission logic manually.
